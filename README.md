## Problem
There is a lot of Nigerian data out there but nobody is using them because they don't understand it and know how to use it.
Why urban planning, well in areas of rapid urbanization and population growth, areas like Lagos, Abuja, Ibadan, Port harcourt e.t.c there is the need to build facilities and structures to accommodate this growth and most of the time the location to set-up this facilities is usually unknown or uncertain and most times both the government and individuals end up wasting resources by creating facilities in improper areas.

## Solution
Making cool visualizations for data so the average nigerian can understand what the data is saying just by looking at it.
We created a ML model that took in data sets like the current population, settlement and structures then predicted likely changes in population and other factors and creates a planned state and where infrastructures should be placed for maximum profit for business and usability for government. So in lay-man terms if you wanted to buy a piece of land to build a house all you needed to do in to come online log on to our website and view areas to get lands that can be used for raising a family based on a planned Urban system.

## Benefits
* Better utilization of available data.
* Enables making of better decisions from data as they are now understandable.
