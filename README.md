## Problem
There is a lot of Nigerian data out there but nobody is using them because they don't understand it and know how to use it.

## Solution
Making cool visualizations for data so the average nigerian can understand what the data is saying just by looking at it.

## Benefits
* Better utilization of available data.
* Enables making of better decisions from data as they are now understandable.
